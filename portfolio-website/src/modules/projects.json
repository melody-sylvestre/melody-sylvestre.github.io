            "description": "I created a website for a fictional company as a personal project. On the frontend, I used React.JS and more particularly the React Router library to create the different pages and elements of this website. Styling was implemented with SCSS. For the backend, I created a REST API in PHP using the MVC framework Slim, in order to link the frontend with the MySQL database. The content of the banner on the homepage is fetched from the database using a GET request to this API. Users' answers to the form on the \"Contact us\" page are stored in the database by sending a POST request to the API.",

We used a MERN stack to create a website where users can either choose their favourite topping among 2 randomly selected toppings or see the top 10 toppings from all the votes. On the frontend, I created the card components in which the toppings are displayed, using React.JS, Typescript and SCSS. I used Node.js, Express.js and Typescript on the backend to implement the endpoint that allows saving the users' votes in the MongoDB database with a POST request.",
