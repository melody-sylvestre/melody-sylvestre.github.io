				<p>Hi, I'm Melody! I recently graduated from <a class="inline_link"
						href="https://io-academy.uk/courses/full-stack-track">the iO Academy bootcamp</a> as a full
					stack software developer. With 10 years of experience in coding from my previous roles as an
					astrophysicist and an operational researcher in international trade, I bring strong problem-solving
					skills and a knack for quickly learning and adapting to new technologies and fields. I believe these
					skills will enable me to excel in my software development career.
				</p>
				<p>I'm curious and thrive on challenges, especially those that push me outside of my comfort zone.
					Coding is my passion, and I'm excited to pursue these interests in my new journey as a software
					developer.
				</p>
				<p>Here's a list of a few technologies and methodologies I have been working on:

		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p class="portfolio_intro_text">
			As a student of the iO Academy full stack software development course, I have worked on several personal
			and team projects. You will find below a brief description of each of them.

				<h3>Company website</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>I created a website for a fictional company as a personal project. On the frontend, I used React.JS and more particularly the React Router library to create the different pages and elements of this website. Styling was implemented with SCSS. For the backend, I created a REST API in PHP using the MVC framework Slim, in order to link the frontend with the MySQL database. The content of the banner on the homepage is fetched from the database using a GET request to this API. Users' answers to the form on the "Contact us" page are stored in the database by sending a POST request to the API. </p>

				<h3>Pizza toppings rater</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>A website where you can vote for your favourite pizza toppings! We used a MERN stack to create a
						website where users can either choose their favourite topping among 2 randomly selected toppings
						or see the top 10 toppings from all the votes. On the frontend, I created the card components in which the
						toppings are displayed, using React.JS, Typescript and SCSS. I used Node.js,
						Express.js and Typescript on the backend to implement the endpoint that allows saving the users' votes in the
						MongoDB database with a POST request.</p>

				<h3>Pro-To-Type</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						This is a typing speed game where players have 60s to copy a randomly generated text. At the end
						of the game, they can see their typing speed and accuracy scores. We used JavaScript, HTML and
						CSS to create this app. I worked on various functionalities of this app such as fetching a
						random text to copy from an API with a GET request, comparing the player's input to the reference text and a timer.
						I was also scrum master for this project.

				<h3>Project management API</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						We created a backend RESTful API for a project management app with PHP and SQL. We used OOP to
						create endpoints following the SOLID principles for the application architecture, allowing users
						to display all the projects from the database or a specific project. I worked on the class
						containing the details of a project, unit testing with PHPUnit and error handling.

				<h3>Food Delivery App</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						We developed the frontend for a food delivery app using Bootstrap CSS and React.JS. I implemented
						the React components that allow diners to choose a restaurant, fetch its menu from a supplied API with a GET request and
						display it on the webpage.

				<h3>iO Academy Portal</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						We contributed to the development of management software for iO Academy, which would handle the
						logistics of its training courses. We implemented a feature allowing students to edit their
						profile. I worked on the PHP backend. I used the existing Slim
						framework to implement a new endpoint for the API so that the new data are validated, sanitised,
						and added to the MySQL database.

					<p>A simple PHP app to visualise a yarn stash. It interrogates a MySQL database and displays all its
