			<div class="about_me_text">
				<p>Hi! I'm Melody! I recently graduated from IO Academy (Bath) as a full stack software developer. In a
					previous life, I worked as a planetary scientist in France and in the UK for 9 years.
				</p>
				<p>I'm curious and I love a good challenge, especially if it gives me an opportunity to get outside of
					my comfort zone! Outside work, I enjoy singing, playing piano, sewing, crochet and all things
					space-related!

				<h3>Pro-To-Type</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
					This is a typing speed game in JavaScript where players have 60s to copy a randomly generated text. At the end of the game they 
					can see their typing speed and the accuracy scores. I worked on various functionalities of this app such as fetching a 
					random text to copy from an API, comparing the player's input to the reference text and a timer. I was also scrum master 
					for this project.

				<h3>Food Delivery App</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						We developed the frontend for a food delivery app using Bootstrap CSS and React Javascript. I worked on the feature that allows diners to choose a restaurant, fetches its menu from a supplied API and displays it on the webpage.

				<h3>Project management API</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
					We created a backend API for a project management app with PHP and SQL. We used OOP to create endpoints following the SOLID principles for the application architecture, allowing users to display all the projects from the database or a specific project. I worked on  the class containing the details of a project, unit testing and error handling.
