				<p>Hi! I'm Melody! I am about to graduate from <a class="inline_link"
						href="https://io-academy.uk/courses/full-stack-track">iO Academy</a> as a full stack software
					developer. In a
					previous life, I worked as an astrophysicist in France and in the UK for 9 years, and then as an
					operational researcher in international trade for UK's civil service.
				</p>
				<p>I'm curious, I love a good challenge - especially if it gets me outside of
					my comfort zone, and I love coding. I am looking forward to pursue these interests in my new career
					as a software developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside work, I enjoy singing with my a cappella choir, playing piano, sewing, crochet and all
					things space-related!

				<h3>Pizza toppings rater</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p> A website where you can vote for your favourite pizza toppings! We used a MERN stack to create a
						website where users can either choose their favourite topping among 2 randomly selected toppings
						or see the top 10 toppings from all the votes. On the frontend, I created the cards in which the
						toppings are displayed, using React.JS, Typescript and SCSS. On the backend, I used Node.js, Express and Typescript
						to implement the endpoint that allows to save the users' votes in the MongoDB database.

				<h3>Pro-To-Type</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						This is a typing speed game where players have 60s to copy a randomly generated text. At the end
						of the game they can see their typing speed and the accuracy scores. We used Javascript, HTML
						and CSS to create this app. I worked on various functionalities of this app such as fetching a
						random text to copy from an API, comparing the player's input to the reference text and a timer.
						I was also scrum master
						for this project.

				<h3>Project management API</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						We created a backend REST API for a project management app with PHP and SQL. We used OOP to create
						endpoints following the SOLID principles for the application architecture, allowing users to
						display all the projects from the database or a specific project. I worked on the class
						containing the details of a project, unit testing and error handling.

				<h3>Food Delivery App</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						We developed the frontend for a food delivery app using Bootstrap CSS and React JS. I
						worked on the feature that allows diners to choose a restaurant, fetches its menu from a
						supplied API and displays it on the webpage.

				<h3>iO Academy Portal</h3>
				<div class="project_text">
					<p>
						We contributed to the development of a management software for iO Academy, which would
						handle the logistics of its training courses (i.e. creating student profiles, registering them
						in a course etc.). We worked on the implementation of a feature that would allow a student to
						edit their profile to add additional information. I worked on the PHP backend. I used the existing Slim framework to implement a
						new endpoint for the API so that the new data are validated, sanitised and added in the MySQL
						database.
