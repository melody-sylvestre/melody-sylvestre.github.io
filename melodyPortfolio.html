					<p>Hi! I'm Melody! I recently graduated from IO Academy (Bath) as a full stack software developer. In a previous life, I worked as a planetary scientist in France and in the UK for 9 years.
						
			 <p>I'm curious and I love a good challenge, especially if it gives me an opportunity to get outside of my comfort zone! Outside work, I enjoy singing, playing piano, sewing, crochet and all things space-related!</p>
